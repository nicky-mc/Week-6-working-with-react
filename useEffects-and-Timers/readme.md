## Clicker Game with Multiple Multipliers

## Features

- Click a button to earn clicks and cookies
- Increase your clicks per second by clicking a button
- Purchase different multipliers to multiply your clicks per second

## Code Explanation

### `App.jsx`

This is the main React component that contains the game logic and user interface.

````jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import "./app.css";

export default function App() {
  // ... (rest of the component code)
}
## Understanding Timers in React

Timers are a crucial part of many web applications, allowing you to execute code at specified intervals or after a delay. In React, we can implement timers using the built-in JavaScript functions `setTimeout` and `setInterval`, along with React's `useEffect` hook for proper management in functional components.

## Basic Timer Concepts

There are two main types of timers in JavaScript:

1. **setTimeout**: Executes a function once after a specified delay.
2. **setInterval**: Executes a function repeatedly at specified intervals.

## Using Timers in React Components

### setTimeout

`setTimeout` is used when you want to delay the execution of a function.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function DelayedMessage() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('This message is delayed by 3 seconds');
    }, 3000);

    // Cleanup function
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, []);

  return <div>Check the console in 3 seconds</div>;
}
